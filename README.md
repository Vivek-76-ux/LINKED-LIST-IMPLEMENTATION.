This project demonstrates a modular and efficient implementation of a Singly Linked List in the C programming language. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data part and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

The implemented program supports the following key operations:

Insertion:
Adds a new node at the end of the linked list. Dynamic memory allocation is used to handle data efficiently.

Deletion (by value):
Removes the first occurrence of a node with the specified value from the list. It safely handles edge cases like deletion from the head or an empty list.

Traversal (Display):
Iterates through the list and prints the value of each node in order, ending with NULL to indicate the end of the list.
